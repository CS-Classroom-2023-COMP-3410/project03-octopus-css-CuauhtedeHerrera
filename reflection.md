Overall I got close. I know I color matched most of the stuff. I again decided to not use chatgpt for this. I did fail in a few areas. 
1. Fonts, I don't know what fonts the screenshot had. So my fonts are off
2. alignment, The lists are off. I couldn't figure out to align them poperly. Only text alignment was in the slides. And I couldn't find a way
3. The quiz. The elements are close to the screenshot, but the alignment are again off. I tried align self, content and items. None of them worked. So there is a thing I am missing about CSS
The major challenge was the due date. I am turning this in late, as I got home late today.
